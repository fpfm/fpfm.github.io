    <h1>Workshop on Foundations for the practical formalization of mathematics (FPFM) </h1>
    <p>April 26â€“27, 2017, Nantes, France</p>

    <p>Meeting in the framework of the  COST Action
      <a href="https://eutypes.cs.ru.nl">EUTypes</a>. </p>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Proof assistants are now state of the art tools for formalizing mathematical reasoning, 
	both for the verification of proofs in mathematics itself and for the verification of software 
	and hardware in computer science. Various proof assistants are based on type theory and it 
	turns out that powerful type theory provide a rich language for capturing notions from computer 
	science and mathematics, ranging from very algorithmic notions (correctness of programs) 
	to very abstract mathematics like homotopy theory (due to the recent advances in Homotopy Type Theory). </p>

    <p>For this workshop we have invited researchers in formalizing mathematics and proof assistants 
	based on dependen type theory, homotopy type theory, higher inductive types and cubical type theory, 
	to discuss how type-based proof assistant can be used for the practical formalization and verification of mathematical proofs. </p>


    <h2>Format</h2>

    <p>The workshop will contributed talks, and possibly a discussion session (depending on scheduling and interest).</p>

	Talk proposals should be sent to Benedikt Ahrens (<a href="mailto:benedikt.ahrens@inria.fr">benedikt.ahrens@inria.fr</a>).

    <h3>Program</h3>

    TBA

    <h2>Practicalities</h2>
	
      The workshop takes place at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cMgqW2QJew32">IMT Atlantique</a>,
       on the outskirts of Nantes. 

    <h3>How to get to IMT Atlantique?</h3>
      To get to IMT Atlantique from the city center of Nantes, take the bus C6 in the direction of Chantrerie.
      Get off the bus at the stop Chantrerie. From the bus stop, it is a 3-minute walk to IMT Atlantique.

        </br>
         You need to validate your ticket upon entering the bus, by putting it into a tiny machine at the entrance of the bus.
         A ticket is valid for one hour, unlimited transfers. You need to validate your ticket every time you enter a bus,
	even if you have validated it before.
	</br>
         Tickets bought at a ticket machine are 1.60EUR. Tickets bought in the bus are 2EUR, and exact change might be needed.
      
	</br>
	
      Be aware that Google Maps does not show public transportation timetables for Nantes.
      Instead, you should use the website of the public transportation organisation, <a href="https://www.tan.fr/">TAN</a>.
      <ul>
         <li> Website of the public transportation service <a href="https://www.tan.fr/welcome-to-nantes-35406.kjsp">TAN</a> (english)</li>
         <li> <a href="./C6-map.pdf">Map of the C6 bus (pdf)</a></li>
	 <li> <a href="./C6-timetable.pdf">Timetable of the C6 bus (pdf)</a></li>
      </ul>

    <h3>How to travel between the city center and the airport?</h3>
     
      A shuttle bus runs between the city center and the airport.
      A ticket is 8.50EUR and is valid one hour from the start of your journey, including transfers.

      </ul>

    <h3>Accommodation</h3>
   
       Since it is necessary to take the bus C6 to IMT Atlantique, I recommend choosing a hotel 
        that is close to a C6 stop. 
	</br>
       Unfortunately, Google Maps does not show the public transportation of
       Nantes, so you need to check against <a href="https://plan-tan.fr/">this plan</a> instead.
      C6 is the light purple line going north-north-east from the city center.
       (Hovering over a line will show its name.)
