The Three-HITs Theorem

We show that all higher inductive types can be constructed from coequalizers, path coequalizers and homotopy colimits. The proof is inspired by Ad√°mek's theorem which constructs inductive types as a colimit of a functor. This way one can reason about all higher inductive types by instead studying a small number of examples.
This is joint work with Andrej Bauer.
